=================

This bookmarklet lets you quickly hear and download pronunciations by native speakers of almost any word in any language from Forvo.com.

When activated, it'll use whatever word you currently have selected, or you can type in anything else.

You can also restrict the search to a specific language by appending a slash, followed by the 2-letter language code, e.g. `que/es` or `skal/no`.

A (free) Forvo API key is required.
